## Introduction 

## Description

### Symplectic Euler
### Spring Force
### Gravitational Force
### Linear Damping Force
### Spring Damping Force



## Examples
### Multiple springs
Multiple springs with increasing damping coefficients oriented along the horizontal and slightly stretched from their rest lengths. Intended to test the behavior of increasing the damping coefficient.

### Cantilever
A cantilever integrated with Symplectic Euler (forward-backward-euler). Intended to test multiple springs acting on the same particle.
